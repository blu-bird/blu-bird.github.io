Hello! I'm Bryan Lu, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences studying
mathematics and computer science at Cornell University. My interests are currently 
split across combinatorics and programming languages, but I also like to be
literate in a variety of other fields, including physics and linguistics.  

I also think a lot about pedagogy and communication in math, and how to bridge 
the gap between intuitive reasoning and rigorous, formal reasoning. 
I help grade for the MATH 2230/MATH 2240 sequence at Cornell, which gives
first-year students a rigorous understanding of linear algebra and 
multivariable calculus (alongside exposure to many other mathematical
disciplines, including real analysis and differential geometry) 
while also giving them training and practice in writing proofs. 

In other things, I dance a lot and I'm currently the performance director for the
Assorted Aces, a beginner-oriented dance group on campus. I also am on the
executive board for Cornell Dancers' Alliance, supporting dance teams on campus
and holding events that bring the dance community at Cornell together. Other interests
include karate, ultimate frisbee, and puzzle hunts.
